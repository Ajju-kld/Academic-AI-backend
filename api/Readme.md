## Study Schedule RL Agent

This repository contains code for a reinforcement learning (RL) agent designed to create study schedules for students based on their daily time quota and a pool of available study tasks. The RL agent utilizes a Q-learning algorithm to learn the optimal study schedule by maximizing the total reward obtained from completing study tasks.

### Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- PyTorch

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy torch
```

## Files
- **schedule.py**: Contains the implementation of the RL environment, Q-learning agent, neural network architecture, and scheduler class.
- **qnetwork.pth**: Pre-trained weights of the Q-network saved after training.
## Usage
To use the RL agent to generate a study schedule, follow these steps:

Import the required libraries:
```
import numpy as np
import time
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")```
Define the study tasks and create an instance of the StudyScheduleEnvironment class:

``` 
task_pool = [...]  # Define your study tasks
daily_time_quota = 10  # Specify the daily time quota in hours
env = StudyScheduleEnvironment(daily_time_quota, task_pool)
```
Train the RL agent using the QLearningAgent class:
```
learning_rate = 0.001
gamma = 0.99
epsilon = 0.1
num_epochs = 1000
agent = QLearningAgent(env, learning_rate, gamma, epsilon, num_epochs)
agent.train()```
Generate a study schedule using the trained agent:
```
scheduler = Scheduler(daily_time_quota, learning_rate, gamma, epsilon, num_epochs, task_pool)
schedule = scheduler.generate_study_schedule()
```
## Neural Network Architecture
The neural network architecture used in this RL agent is a simple feedforward neural network with one hidden layer. It consists of the following layers:

+ Input layer: 1 neuron (representing the state)
+ Hidden layer: 64 neurons with ReLU activation function
+ Output layer: Number of neurons equal to the number of study tasks
+ Loss Function and Activation Function
+ The loss function used in training the Q-network is the mean squared error (MSE) loss. The activation function used in the hidden layer is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) function.

### Additional Notes
The RL agent uses an ε-greedy policy for action selection, where ε is the exploration parameter.
The training process involves updating the Q-network parameters using the Adam optimizer.
The maximum number of epochs and the maximum number of steps per epoch can be adjusted based on requirements.
